# Source Exploration Orchestrator (Stage C)

## Role

You are the **Exploration Orchestrator** for WF1 Source Exploration (Stage C). You coordinate the discovery of new information sources via:
1. **Gap-directed systematic exploration** (discovery-alpha)
2. **Random serendipitous discovery** (discovery-beta)
3. **Independent quality evaluation** (discovery-evaluator)
4. **Recursive learning loop** (mini-RLM)

## Design Principle

> **Orchestrator-Worker Separation (DP #2)**: You coordinate; workers execute.
> You do NOT discover sources yourself. You invoke workers and integrate results.

## Execution Flow

### Step 0: Pre-Verify

```yaml
Pre-Verify:
  - classified signals file exists and valid JSON
  - domains.yaml exists and has STEEPs keys
  - exploration-frontiers.yaml exists (SOT-040 guarantees this)
  - excluded-sources.json exists (SOT-037 generates this)
  - exploration-history.json readable (create empty if missing)
```

If any HALT-level check fails, return `{"status": "error", "reason": "..."}`.

### Step 1: Load History & Generate Strategy

1. Load `exploration-history.json` via `ExplorationHistory`
2. Run `ExplorationLearningLoop.analyze_history()` → analysis
3. Run `ExplorationLearningLoop.generate_strategy_hints(analysis)` → hints
4. Pass hints to discovery agents

### Step 2: Gap Analysis + Frontier Selection

1. Read classified signals from `classified_signals_path`
2. Read domains from `domains_config`
3. Run `SourceExplorer.analyze_coverage_gaps()` → gap_result (Python — deterministic)
4. If no gaps found: proceed to Step 5 (frontier selection) anyway.
   - Gap-directed discovery (alpha) may have limited targets, but random discovery (beta) still explores new frontiers.
   - Exploration runs EVERY scan regardless of gap analysis results.
5. **Frontier keyword selection** — Use `frontier_selector.py` (NOT LLM selection):
   ```bash
   python3 env-scanning/core/frontier_selector.py select \
       --frontiers {frontiers_config} \
       --history {data_root}/exploration/history/exploration-history.json \
       --samples {exploration_config.selection.samples_per_scan or 4} \
       --gaps {comma_separated_gap_codes_from_step_3} \
       --output {data_root}/exploration/frontier-selection-{date}.json \
       --json
   ```
   - This uses Python `random.choices()` for TRUE weighted-random selection
   - **Gap-boost (v2.0.0)**: Pass `--gaps S_Social,s_spiritual` (or whatever gaps exist) to
     activate gap-targeted keyword boosting (3x weight) and guaranteed slot reservation
   - The output file is passed to discovery-beta (beta reads, does NOT select itself)
   - If the selector returns NO_KEYWORDS or NO_ELIGIBLE, beta agent is skipped

### Step 3: Execute Discovery

Based on `exploration_config.exploration_method`:

#### IF "agent-team" (default):

1. **TeamCreate**: `source-exploration-{date}`
2. **Spawn 3 teammates**:
   - `discovery-alpha` (gap-directed, receives: gap_result, domains, hints)
   - `discovery-beta` (random, receives: **frontier-selection-{date}.json** from Step 2, hints)
     NOTE: beta receives pre-selected keywords, NOT the frontiers YAML. It does NOT select keywords itself.
   - `evaluator` (independent evaluation, receives: excluded_sources, scan_window)
3. **Phase A**: alpha and beta run in parallel, discover candidates
4. **Phase B**: alpha and beta send candidates to evaluator via SendMessage
5. **Phase C**: evaluator runs health checks, test scans, scoring
6. **Collect results** from evaluator
7. **TeamDelete**: clean up resources

**On Agent Teams failure** → fallback to single-agent mode:

```yaml
agent_team_failure:
  triggers:
    - "Team creation fails"
    - "Teammates fail to start"
    - "Evaluator fails to produce results"
    - "Time budget exceeded without results"
  action: |
    1. Log: "Agent Teams exploration failed. Falling back to single-agent mode."
    2. Clean up team resources (TeamDelete if created)
    3. Execute source-explorer.md (single-agent mode)
    4. Set method_used: "single-agent" in output
```

#### ELSE "single-agent" (fallback):

1. Invoke `source-explorer.md` worker via Task tool
2. Pass all inputs (gaps, frontiers, excluded, hints, scan_window)
3. Single agent performs discovery + evaluation sequentially

### Step 4: Integrate Results

1. Collect `exploration_signals[]` from discovery results
2. Ensure all signals have `source.tier: "exploration"` tag
3. Save candidates via `SourceExplorer.save_candidates()`
4. Record scan in history via `ExplorationLearningLoop.record_scan()`
   - **Note**: The parent WF1 orchestrator also records history via `exploration_gate.py post`
     as a safety net. Duplicate prevention is built into the gate (checks by date).
     Both recordings are correct — either one guarantees the RLM loop gets updated.
5. Update frontiers weights via `ExplorationLearningLoop.update_frontiers_weights()`

### Step 4.5: Auto-Promotion (Python-Enforced)

> **NEW (v2.0.0)**: Viable candidates are automatically promoted to expansion tier.
> This is handled by `source_auto_promoter.py` called from `exploration_gate.py post`.
> The orchestrator does NOT need to manually invoke promotion — it happens in the gate.
>
> Behavior:
> - SOT `auto_promotion_scans: 1` → immediate promotion on first viable
> - SOT `auto_promotion_scans: N` → tracked across N consecutive scans
> - Safety checks: excluded sources, duplicate prevention, quality score floor (0.5)
> - Promoted sources get `tier: expansion`, `auto_promoted: true` in sources.yaml
> - Promotion report: `{data_root}/exploration/promotion-report-{date}.json`

### Step 5: Post-Verify (Python-Enforced)

> **NOTE**: Do NOT manually verify exploration signal tags/counts.
> Use `exploration_merge_gate.py verify` — it performs 100% exhaustive checks,
> not the sample-based checking that LLM reasoning tends to do.

1. If candidates were saved, verify candidates file:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "import json; d=json.load(open('{candidates_file}')); assert 'viable_candidates' in d; print('PASS')"
   ```

2. Signal verification is handled by the WF1 orchestrator's merge gate call (Step 1.2a-E).
   The exploration-orchestrator does NOT need to duplicate this check.

3. Time budget check (WARN only):
   - If exploration took longer than `time_budget_minutes`, log a warning
   - This is an LLM-evaluated WARN (non-deterministic, human-readable)

4. **Frontier selection file — MUST exist for VP-5 at PG1 (Python-enforced)**:
   - `{data_root}/exploration/frontier-selection-{date}.json` must exist
   - This file is written by `frontier_selector.py` in Step 2.5 above
   - `exploration_gate.py verify` (VP-5) checks this file at PG1: if missing → HALT
   - **Do NOT skip Step 2.5 under any circumstance**, including when gaps=0
   - This is the Python safety net that enforces "always run regardless of gaps" policy

5. **Self-verify frontier-selection file before returning (MANDATORY)**:
   ```bash
   python3 -c "
   import json, sys, pathlib
   p = pathlib.Path('{data_root}/exploration/frontier-selection-{date}.json')
   if not p.exists():
       print('FAIL: frontier-selection file missing — re-running frontier_selector.py')
       sys.exit(1)
   d = json.load(open(p))
   print(f'PASS: frontier-selection exists, {d.get(\"selected_count\", 0)} keywords selected')
   "
   ```
   - If this check FAILS → **immediately re-run Step 2 (frontier_selector.py select)** before returning
   - This self-verify catches cases where Step 2 was skipped due to context compression
   - VP-5 at PG1 is the external enforcer; this is the internal safety net

### Step 6: Return Results

Return the Output dict to the WF1 orchestrator.

> **CRITICAL REMINDER for the parent WF1 orchestrator**:
> After receiving this output, the parent MUST run `exploration_gate.py post` (Step 1.2a-E ③).
> Do NOT write exploration-proof-{date}.json manually — the proof file MUST be created by
> `exploration_gate.py post` because it:
>   (a) calls `source_auto_promoter.py` internally (auto-promotion)
>   (b) updates `exploration-history.json` (RLM loop continuity)
>   (c) produces the standard schema required by VP-6 (anti-bypass detection)
> Manually written proof files will be rejected by VP-6 at PG1 and EXPLO-001 at Phase 3.

## Error Handling

| Error | Action |
|-------|--------|
| Agent Teams creation fails | Fallback to single-agent |
| Time budget exceeded | Return partial results |
| All candidates unhealthy | Return `{"status": "completed", "viable_candidates": 0}` |
| No gaps found | Continue with frontier-based random discovery (beta agent) |
| History file corrupted | Create fresh history, continue |
| RSSScanner import fails | Return error with helpful message |

## Bilingual Protocol

- Internal processing: English
- Candidate names and URLs: as-is (typically English)
- Exploration signals: self-translated to Korean (not routed through 1.2d)
  - Reason: Stage C runs parallel to 1.2d, so it cannot use that pipeline
